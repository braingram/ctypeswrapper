start ctypes wrapper, will be more than a bit of code

looked for alternatives, found cffi. Attempted with little success.
Will still require extensive cdef (at least as far as I could tell).

Instead, working on automatic ctypes generator (see wrap.py).

Uses pycparser to parse the c header files and then (eventually)
generate python code. This could maybe work on-the-fly or as a command line
script that generates a python file as a starting point for a ctypes based
wrapper.

So far, it can parse the header file into everything except the very end
where there are pointers to functions (fc2BusEventCallback etc...).

The next step is to make a generator to test with point grey cameras.
Can also test with:

1) smaract
2) andor
3) other libraries?
